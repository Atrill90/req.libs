# Req.libs
This is a *Mad Libs* inspired game in which the user picks from one of several categories. The user
is then prompted for verbs, nouns, adverbs, etc. per needed within the story. The paragraph is then combined with the user's input and a story is shown to the user. This project's purpose was to, as a team, create a full stack application complete with an express router, a database, and polished UI.

## The Future of this project
If we were to do a version 2, we would love to inclued a multiplayer feature in which stories could be compared and friends could upvote which was the best story. Another multiplayer idea was for friends to take turns filling in blanks on the same story and see what came up. Other future versions may include to limit the visisbility of your user made stories.
