<h1>Req.libs</h1>
<p>This is a <em>Mad Libs</em> inspired game in which the user picks from one of several categories. The user
is then prompted for verbs, nouns, adverbs, etc. per needed within the story. The paragraph is then combined with the user's input and a story is shown to the user.</p>

<h2>About this project maybe?</h2>
<p> maybe tell more about what version 2 would have or the process
for making version 1? maybe more at the top?</p>
<p>This project's purpose was to, as a team, create a full stack application complete with an express router, 
a database, and UI. We worked to create a MadLibs-style game </p>
